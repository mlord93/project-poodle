Recently spayed & current on vaccinations. Tan & White Parti-Color. Re-Homing fee $400.00. She is currently being Fostered in the Greater Portland area, but can be placed in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana& Utah. She was sold as a breeder to a Doodle breeder, but she didn\"t like their male. She was reported to be unsocial with other dogs because of this, but being in Foster care has proven otherwise. She is a bit shy still in public places, but had come a long way in short time. She LOVES playing ball & may make a great agility prospect. Contact one of the NWSPN Admins for further information. Adoption application is in our FB Group\"s Files Section",
